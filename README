Apache/EnvDir version 1.00
==========================

This module allows dynamic updating of Apache Environment variables via
a directory of files. A new Apache configuration directive, EnvDir, takes
either one or two arguments. The first is a directory containing files
to be turned into environment variables, where the name of the file becomes
the variable name and the contents of the file become the value. The second
argument is an optional prefix that will be prepended to the variable name.

The environment variables are visible to other Apache modules such as
mod_cgi and mod_include. The file contents are cached in memory at startup,
but changes to the files are reflected immediately without restarting the
server.

INSTALLATION

   perl Makefile.PL
   make

DEPENDENCIES

  This module only works in the 1.3 Apache tree at this point. The
  "test" target requires Apache::Test and CGI.pm.
